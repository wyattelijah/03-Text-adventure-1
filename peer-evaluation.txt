What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?

    This project taught me a better way to let players know when to quit the game.

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

    More effort into putting in more locations, situations, etc.

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

    Only suggestion is to rename the main file for the game, got a little confused on how to find it at first. 

What could have been clearer or better commented?

    Where the actual edited game file was (possibly delete the other uneeded files). 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

    N/A

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

    Yes.

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

    Seems descriptive enough, details what the main files do.

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

    The game is creative and funny, no errors from what I saw.
