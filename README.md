# 03-Text-adventure

This is my solution to the 03-Text adventure assignment for MSCH-C220. I have included a couple of .json game description files for anyone to play with.

main_simple.py contains the code we worked out in class (or a close approximation to it). It runs the zork.json file, as long as it is in the same directory.

main.py is a little more complicated. 

Features to add at some point
 * Objects in the world
 * inventory management
 * Points (for objects acquired or locations visited)
 * Flags for accomplished events
 * Conditional exits (based on flags)
 * etc.
